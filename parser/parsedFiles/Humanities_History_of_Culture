Between Renaissance and Inquisition: Censorship and Religious Conflict in Spain’s Golden Age
Early modern Spain has simultaneously been perceived as an artistic Golden Age (which saw a flourishing production of plays, verse, and prose) and as an era in which censorship and religious intolerance closed off Spain and its empire to the wider world. The course explores this central paradox in Spanish religious, cultural and intellectual history, through an interdisciplinary examination of various literary genres, trial records, painting and architecture. It examines the foundation of the Spanish Inquisition in a society which included Christians, Muslims, and Jews; it traces the development of Catholic laws and courts both in European contexts and in Spain’s American colonies.
